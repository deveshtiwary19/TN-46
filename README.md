Following is the Chennai based local E-Commerce application (Testing Beta Version). 

Go to the screenshots folder, to have a look at our marvellous UI design in both day and night theme.
For rest, switch to the app>>main directory for the xml and java source code.
The manifest file, for the project is equally important as many external dependencies has been added.
The payment gateway(Razorpay) integration has set with a Test API key, which you need to replace with the one of your own in manifest.xml file.

==>> Run the project once in you Android Studio IDE with an Active internet connection and it will download the gradle requirements and sync with the dependencies automatically.
